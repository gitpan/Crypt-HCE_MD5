Revision history for Perl extension Crypt::HCE_MD5.

0.01  Wed Oct 14 16:23:57 1998
	- original version; created by h2xs 1.18

0.02 implementation

0.03 moved examples to their own directory

0.05 fixed description man bug (had an extra space)
     added check for MIME::Base64 

0.40 updated to use Digest::MD5 by Gisle Aas

0.45 fixed chaining key bug, thanks to Jake Angerman for
     pointing out the weakness

0.50 removed syslog from test.pl so that it runs under
     ActiveState without problems
     to prevent early line breakage switched the base64 encode
     eol to "" so it wouldn't insert newlines.  This means if 
     you use newlines for your data breaks, like the examples do,
     you'll need to add an explicit \n to your send line, like
     print { $self->{'Socket'} } "$enc_item\n";
